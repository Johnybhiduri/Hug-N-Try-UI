#  FIRST SEARCH AI

This project gives you an easy interface to explore and use Hugging Face models for tasks like text generation, summarization, text classification, text-to-image, text-to-video, audio processing, and more — all in one place.

It’s a simple React app that lets anyone browse available models with inference support and chat or interact with them directly.
No need to dig through APIs — just pick a model and start experimenting!

💡 Why I Built This

I made this to provide a simple and open interface for anyone who wants to explore Hugging Face models without coding or backend setup.
I didn’t find any open-source tool that lets users test any model (text, image, audio, etc.) this easily — so I built one!
